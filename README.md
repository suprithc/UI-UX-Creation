can help to connect with more clients and grow our business. But not all leads are generated

buying lead lists and networking.

* Insurance policies can be modified and offered to people depending on their risk profile
  and the need of the insurer.
* The amount is mentioned in the insurance policy and the more the insurance cover the
  more will be the premium which one has to pay to the company.
* A person can take more than one policy, in other words there are no restrictions on the
  number of policies one can take.
* There must be a large number of similar risks.
* The loss caused by the risk must be definite.
* The cause of insuring must be economically feasible.
* Sharing of Risk-Insurance is a device to share the financial losses which might befall an
  individual or his family on the happening of a specified event.
* Co-operative Device-The most important feature of every insurance plan is the
  cooperation of a large number of persons who, in effect, agree to share the financial loss
  arising due to a particular risk that is insured.

### About Figma:
Figma is a browser-based UI and UX design application, with excellent design, prototyping, and
code-generation tools. It’s currently (arguably) the industry’s leading interface design tool, with
robust features which support teams working on every phase of the design process. If you
haven’t already, try it!

* In Figma, a node on a vector can have multiple segments attached to it (more than just
  the standard two). The more complex shapes you can make with these are called “vector
  networks”.
* Figma allows you to quickly an easily import multiple images at once, placing them exactly
  where you want them.
* When you move an object around the canvas in Figma you’ll see its height and width
  reflected in the rulers.
* Copy the SVG code directly from an object within Figma, and conversely, you can copy
  SVG code from a code editor and paste it as a graphic onto the Figma canvas
